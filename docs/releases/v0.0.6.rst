v0.0.6 (August 2016)
--------------------

This is a minor release in the unstable 0.0.x series, with breaking API changes.

Highlights include a refactor of base classes to provide a more consistent and extensible API,
the construction of this documentation and incremental improvements to the continuous integration.

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Objects no longer take pandas dataframes as input directly, but instead require molecules
to be passed as a Series, with their data as a supplemental series or dataframe (this may
be reverted in a patch).

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Base classes were established for ``Transformer``, ``Filter``, ``TransformFilter``.
Verbosity options were added, allowing progress bars for most objects.
Dataset support was added.
